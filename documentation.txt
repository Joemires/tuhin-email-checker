Advice
Selenium and chrome sits on the server I've added to this and this server is only meant for selenium and chrome development so for speed and less configuration I'll advice you point it to it or go with a cloud selenium SauceLabs, BrowserStack or TestingBot
I'm providing you with this selenium environment for free tho compare to the cloud selenium environment proviers

PHPBrowser has much limitation, selenium chrome drive automate a browser compare to PHPBrowser which has many gaps. If you prefer PHPBrowser, contact me to make changes
